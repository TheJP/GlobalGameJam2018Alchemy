# Alchemission - The All Came
Create and research alchemystic materials in your own tower. Sounds very cosy, but unfortunately you're under constant siege from gruelsome creatures. Use your powerful know-how in the field of alchemy to defend your tower. Get help from a nearby plumber to do so! Get a friend of you to play the "Alchemission - The Mischen" and send you TRANSMISSIONS of ingredients for your alchemic endeavours. And send screaming verbal TRANSMISSIONS his way if the mission proofs impossible.
